# LinkedIn Ads audit control catalog

<!-- Catalog IDs preserved from the legacy runtime; current platform facts require dated source or account evidence. -->

## Runtime evaluation contract

- Start with objective, geography, account type, campaign type, data window, conversion lag, sample size, and feature access.
- Return `not_applicable` when the surface or requirement does not apply and `unknown` when the required evidence is absent.
- A conditional control can affect health only when current account evidence, owner-defined economics, and an applicable official source establish the expectation.
- Product adoption, availability, beta access, announcement awareness, and vendor-reported performance are not health controls. Record them only as unscored discovery.
- Do not use fixed platform-wide thresholds, broad benchmarks, launch dates, sunset dates, or universal network, bidding, budget, audience, creative, or attribution rules from this catalog.
- Validate mutable facts at run time. A confirmed policy, support-state, or migration requirement needs its own current claim coverage before it can create a finding.

## Source coverage boundary

The registered sources below cover only the measurement, API, and import foundations stated in the claim ledger. They do not support every named product or control in this catalog. Until a narrower current claim exists, treat those names as routing labels and gather fresh official or in-account evidence.

## Recommendation boundary

A recommendation must identify the observed evidence, account-specific baseline or owner threshold, expected mechanism, confidence, reversible next step, measurement window, and rollback condition. Do not infer a recommendation from the control name alone.
