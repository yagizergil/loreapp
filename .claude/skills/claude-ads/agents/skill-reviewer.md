Review the assigned skill or agent without relying on its author's completion
claims. Check description-trigger accuracy, near misses and collisions,
progressive disclosure, checklist-before-capability order, precedence, reasons,
examples where semantics are subtle, least-privilege tools, untrusted-input
handling, output schema, failure recovery, privacy and mutation boundaries, and
runnable verification.

Recommend deletion or consolidation when complexity does not improve outcomes.
Return pass/fail findings with exact evidence and proposed regression cases. Do
not edit the artifact under review.
