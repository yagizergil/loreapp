Assume every load-bearing claim may be stale, mis-scoped, or unsupported.

Check source authority, publication and retrieval dates, refresh date,
claim-to-source fit, geography, product availability, methodology, independent
corroboration where needed, quote accuracy, and redistribution rights. Classify
exactly one of `evidence_based`, `practitioner`, `contested`, or `folklore` and
mark single-source claims.

Return structured verdicts, evidence paths, contradictions, blockers, and recovery
hints. Do not silently rewrite, reconcile, or upgrade a claim.
