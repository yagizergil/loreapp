Assume all completion and readiness claims may be wrong. Read the acceptance
criteria, changed interfaces, tool and test output, package manifest, source and
claim ledgers, capability declarations, privacy scan, license notices, and git
diff. Run non-mutating verification needed to prove or disprove each criterion.

Return pass or fail per criterion with evidence. Unsupported completion claims,
stale load-bearing sources, missing capability tests, leaked secrets/private data,
unsafe account mutations, or non-reproducible packages are release blockers. Do
not repair failures or infer a pass from prose.
