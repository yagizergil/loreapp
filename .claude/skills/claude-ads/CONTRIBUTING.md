# Contributing to Claude Ads

Claude Ads accepts focused, source-grounded changes that preserve privacy,
capability honesty, deterministic verification, and read-only defaults.

## Before changing code or guidance

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, the control-plane boundaries, and the relevant skill,
   implementation, fixtures, and tests.
2. Search the ecosystem disposition ledger and current issues to avoid repeating
   reviewed work.
3. For platform, policy, API, regulation, benchmark, or specification changes,
   collect current official or primary evidence and update source/claim coverage.
4. For an external repository idea, record its license and provenance. Public does
   not mean reusable.

Never commit credentials, client/account exports, customer data, private prompts,
raw private research, local absolute paths, or agent transcripts.

## Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/claude-ads.git
cd claude-ads
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -e . -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

Install the current checkout into a host only when needed:

```bash
bash install.sh --source=local
```

Do not use curl-to-shell installation or silent global Python mutation.

## Pull requests

- Create a focused branch and keep unrelated changes out.
- State the problem, evidence, public contract changes, risks, and verification.
- Add regression tests derived from the failure or intended capability.
- Preserve JSON schema compatibility or declare a major contract change.
- Update the capability manifest only when implementation, fixtures, tests, and
  evidence justify the new status.
- Run the repository audit and full test suite.

```bash
python scripts/release.py audit
python -m pytest -q
```

Required remote CI must pass; local success does not substitute for skipped or
billing-blocked checks.

## Skills and agents

- Skill directories use lowercase kebab-case and `ads-` names.
- `SKILL.md` frontmatter contains only `name` and a comprehensive `description`.
- Put what the skill does and when it triggers in the description.
- Keep `SKILL.md` under approximately 500 lines/5,000 tokens.
- Move detailed facts, controls, examples, and schemas behind progressive
  disclosure.
- Use ordered checks, explicit precedence, operational reasons, untrusted-input
  boundaries, output contracts, and recovery behavior.
- Workers return schema-valid results; one conductor owns final artifacts.
- Agents receive least-privilege tools and no implicit mutation authority.

Add positive, near-miss, ambiguous, and collision cases for new routing surfaces.
High-risk behavior also belongs in `evals/v2-behavior-evals.json`.

## Platform controls and sources

- Preserve stable control IDs once released.
- Model applicability, availability, geography, account maturity, required inputs,
  severity, source IDs, stability, and scoring behavior.
- Keep optional, beta, premium, unavailable, and ineligible features unscored.
- Do not duplicate penalties for one root problem.
- Do not add a precise threshold without source, scope, methodology, and expiry.
- Unknown and not-applicable are valid results, not failures to hide.

## Adapters and account changes

Every adapter implements capability discovery, read snapshot, draft, apply,
verify, and rollback interfaces. New adapters begin read-only.

A write capability requires sandbox fixtures, idempotency, exact object scope,
approval, ceilings, verification, audit, rollback, and adversarial tests. Permanent
deletion is unsupported in v2.

## Security reports

Do not open a public issue for a vulnerability. Use the repository's private
[GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/claude-ads/security/advisories/new)
channel and include the affected version, reproduction, and impact.

## Release work

Release candidates must pass source freshness, deterministic/model evaluations,
security/privacy/license scans, installation matrices, reproducible packaging,
SBOM/checksum generation, and fresh-context verification. Repository visibility
remains private until a separate public-release gate is explicitly approved.
