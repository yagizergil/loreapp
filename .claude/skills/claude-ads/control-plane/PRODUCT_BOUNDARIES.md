# Product Boundaries

## Buyer and promise

Claude Ads serves agencies, consultants, and in-house paid-media teams that
need repeatable, evidence-backed audits, plans, creative workflows, monitoring,
experiments, and reports across major advertising platforms.

It turns authorized exports or account reads into normalized observations,
findings, recommendations, and client-ready deliverables. It is advisory and
read-only by default.

## Supported product surface

- Primary runtime: Claude Code through `/ads` for a standalone skill install or
  `/claude-ads:ads` for the necessarily namespaced plugin install.
- Portable surface: Agent Skills-compatible runtimes and a matching CLI where
  executable support exists.
- Target platforms: Google, Meta, YouTube, LinkedIn, TikTok, Microsoft, Apple,
  Amazon, Reddit, Pinterest, Snapchat, and X Ads.
- Cross-platform workflows: attribution, tracking, creative, landing pages,
  budgeting, forecasting, experiments, competitor research, policy, privacy,
  and regulatory review.
- Canonical machine output: versioned JSON. Human formats are renderings of the
  same run bundle.

## Non-promises

- A skill file is not proof of a working integration.
- A benchmark is not a guarantee of future performance or platform approval.
- A recommendation is not legal, tax, accounting, or investment advice.
- Claude Ads does not bypass platform policy, consent requirements, access
  controls, or geographic restrictions.
- Claude Ads does not infer missing account facts and present them as observed.
- Claude Ads does not guarantee live read or write support for every platform.
  Availability is declared per capability and adapter.
- Claude Ads does not produce platform health from an audit checklist alone.
  Disabled scoring profiles yield no health score; watchlist findings remain
  unscored until their evidence and severity contract is approved.
- Claude Ads does not permanently delete campaigns or account objects in v2.
- Claude Ads does not publish client data, raw private research, captured
  prompts, or credentials.

## Mutation boundary

Account writes are disabled unless the platform capability is independently
enabled and a mutation plan contains an exact before/after diff, object IDs,
owner, approval record, idempotency key, blast-radius limit, verification
window, audit destination, and rollback procedure. Missing budget or policy
ceilings block the write. Pause or archive is preferred to deletion.

## Evidence boundary

Current platform, API, policy, specification, regulation, and benchmark claims
must point to dated entries in the source and claim ledgers. Stale, contested,
practitioner, and single-source evidence must be labeled. Unknown and
not-applicable are valid outputs and must not be converted into passes.
